# Easy Bluetooth File Transfer
This is just a personal project I've developed driven by *curiosity*. (So is more like a proof of concept)

In order to be able to successfully compile on your PC, you also need to add the [32feet.NET](https://www.nuget.org/packages/32feet.NET) library to the project.

The project is pretty basic, you can select a single file, scan for the available Bluetooth devices, choose one and start the file transfer.
